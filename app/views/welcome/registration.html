<p>The Bolshoi Ballet Academy and Russian Ballet International are very excited to bring you another summer of our Intensive Master Classes in Moscow. Since its creation, the Bolshoi Ballet Academy has been at the forefront of providing students with the widest range of dancing opportunities. The program explores innovative balletic movement, and provides students the opportunity to work with staff teachers at the Academy. It provides classical training for dancers to improve their capabilities and expand their technical range. The program is all encompassing; students can improve in their technical abilities, while growing as artists by being exposed to new and creative instructors. These programs were developed for students that want to push beyond the realm of technique and tradition. It is designed for dancers who are interested in exploring the foundations of ballet movement. These programs are high energy. Students must be ready to work hard, dance hard, and emerge as new, unique and versatile artists. The intensives empower the students to challenge themselves to become working artists in the dance world.
